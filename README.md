# SnakeEyes
Use your points to roll two or more dice, and the sum of the numbers you get is added to your score. To use any dice, you have to use a number of points equal to half the amount of faces it has. If you get any consecutive even number, you get a bonus. If you get any consecutive odd number, you get a penalty. But if you get snake eyes or don't have enough points, it's Game Over! You can use a d4, a d6, a d8, a d12, or a d20. You start with 5 points.
